In ServiceNow, a "Normal Change" refers to a type of change request that is considered routine, low-risk, and follows a predefined and standardized process. Normal changes are typically used for well-understood and frequently occurring changes that have been thoroughly tested and documented. These changes are often repetitive and don't require the same level of scrutiny and approval as higher-risk changes. Here are some key characteristics of normal changes in ServiceNow:

Standardized Process: Normal changes follow a predefined and standardized process that has been established in advance. The steps, tasks, and approvals required for normal changes are typically well-documented and understood.

Low Risk: Normal changes are associated with low risk and are not expected to have a significant impact on services or systems. They are generally considered routine and non-disruptive.

Minimal Change Advisory Board (CAB) Involvement: Since normal changes are low-risk and standardized, they often require minimal or no formal approval from the Change Advisory Board (CAB). Instead, they may be approved by a designated change manager or other responsible party.

Faster Approval: Normal changes can be approved more quickly than standard or emergency changes because they have already undergone thorough testing and evaluation.

Documentation: Although normal changes are routine, they still require documentation. This documentation ensures that the change process is followed consistently and provides a record of the change for auditing and compliance purposes.

Examples: Common examples of normal changes include software updates, minor hardware replacements, configuration changes to non-critical systems, and routine maintenance activities.

Automation: Many organizations use automation to expedite the approval and implementation of normal changes, further reducing the manual effort required.

Normal changes are a valuable concept in change management because they help streamline and simplify the handling of low-risk, repetitive changes, allowing organizations to focus their resources and attention on more complex and critical changes. However, it's essential to define clear criteria for categorizing changes as "normal" and ensure that the predefined processes are followed consistently to maintain the integrity of the change management process.
