# Flow Designer
- Flow Designer is a Now Platform feature that enables rich process automation capabilities in a consolidated design environment to develop and manage flows. Its main advantage lies in the use of natural language to configure automation without having to write code. 
# Benefits pf Flow Designer

- It uses natural language descriptions to help non-technical users understand triggers, actions, inputs, and outputs. You do not have to  script to us Flow Designer
- It reduces development costs by providing a library of reusable flow components in the base system created by ServiceNow Developers. 
- It reduces upgrade costs with upgrade-safe platform logic replacing complex custom scripts
- It allows you to develop, share, and reuse your custon flow components with other flow designers. 
- It displays flows as diagrams to help developers see paths and connections to understand and improve flows. 

# Flow Designer vs. Process Automation Designer (PAD)

    - It provides end-users with a simplifies task-oriented view of your process (called Playbook)
