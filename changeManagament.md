# Change Management


In ServiceNow, "Change Management" is a process and module within the platform that helps organizations manage and control the process of making changes to their IT infrastructure, applications, services, and other configuration items in a structured and controlled manner. The Change Management process in ServiceNow follows ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) best practices, which are widely accepted as a framework for IT service management.

The main objective of Change Management in ServiceNow is to minimize the impact of changes on IT services and business operations while ensuring that changes are implemented in a consistent, efficient, and controlled manner. It aims to reduce the risk of disruptions, errors, and incidents that can arise from poorly planned or unauthorized changes.

The Change Management module in ServiceNow typically includes the following key features:

Change Requests (CRs): Users can raise Change Requests to propose and document changes to IT services or assets. These requests go through a structured approval process to ensure that all relevant stakeholders review and authorize the changes.

Change Approval Workflow: ServiceNow allows organizations to define custom workflows for the approval of changes. This workflow ensures that the proposed change is reviewed by the appropriate stakeholders, such as change managers, technical experts, and business representatives, before it is implemented.

Change Calendar: The Change Calendar provides a centralized view of all planned changes, helping teams avoid scheduling conflicts and allowing them to plan their activities accordingly.

Change Implementation and Review: ServiceNow enables the tracking of change implementation progress and post-implementation reviews to assess the success and impact of the change.

Change Records: Every change is recorded and stored as a Change Record, which serves as an audit trail and a historical record of all changes made within the organization.

Change Risk Assessment: The platform may offer features to assess the risk associated with proposed changes, helping teams prioritize and plan their change implementation.

Overall, Change Management in ServiceNow enhances the reliability and stability of IT services by providing a structured approach to managing changes, minimizing disruptions, and facilitating collaboration among IT teams and stakeholders involved in the change process.
